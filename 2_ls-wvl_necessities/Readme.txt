This is a work in progress. I am currently attending college and working a full-time job so please don't expect immediate results.
I can only test these steps on the LS-WVL (Buffalo Linkstation Pro Duo). If anybody wants to try it on another device go right ahead
but know that by doing so you will be doing it at your own risk.

Steps
1. run gpio_install.sh
	- this will install a small hack that fixes the gpio interface disappearing after each reboot (it's messy but works!)
